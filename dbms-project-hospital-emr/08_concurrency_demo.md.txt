# 08 Concurrency Demo

## Scenario
Two schedulers try to book Dr. Smith at 9:00 AM simultaneously.
1. **User A** starts transaction, checks slot (Empty).
2. **User B** starts transaction, checks slot (Empty).
3. **User A** inserts record.
4. **User B** tries to insert record -> **Database Lock Wait / Error** because of overlap logic (if constraints set) or timestamp ordering.
