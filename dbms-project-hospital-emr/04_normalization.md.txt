# 04 Normalization Process

## Functional Dependencies
1. `patient_id` -> `first_name`, `last_name`, `dob`, `insurance_id`
2. `provider_id` -> `name`, `specialty_id`
3. `specialty_id` -> `specialty_name`

## Normal Forms
* **1NF:** All attributes are atomic. We separated `first_name` and `last_name` instead of one `full_name` field. No repeating groups (e.g., we did not put multiple medicines in one cell in the Encounters table; we created a separate Prescriptions table).
* **2NF:** No partial dependencies. All non-key attributes depend on the full primary key. Since most tables have single-column PKs, this is satisfied.
* **3NF:** No transitive dependencies.
    * *Initial Design Issue:* If we stored `specialty_name` inside the `Providers` table, it would be a transitive dependency (`provider_id` -> `specialty_name` via `specialty_id`).
    * *Solution:* We normalized this by creating a separate `Specialties` table and linking via ID.

## Denormalization Note
We intentionally kept `billed_amount` in the `Encounters` table for simpler reporting, even though it could technically be calculated from a separate billing table. This reduces join complexity for financial reports.
